Adapted code from the [Apache Spark Standalone Cluster on Docker](https://github.com/cluster-apps-on-docker/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker) project.

***
## Spark Local
Spark is running in local mode on your machine.

1. Git clone this repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:halltape/SparkCluster.git
```
2. Download datasets
```bash
cd SparkCluster/build/workspace && \
mkdir -p data && \
curl -L -o data/customs_data.csv "https://huggingface.co/datasets/halltape/customs_data/resolve/main/customs_data.csv?download=true"
```

3. Install pyspark and Jupyter Lab
```bash
pip install pyspark jupyterlab
```

4. Start Jupyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

5. Open **spark.ipynb** in Jupyter Lab

***
❌ **If you encounter the following error when running PySpark:**
```
RuntimeError: Python in worker has different version 3.12 than that in driver 3.10, PySpark cannot run with different minor versions. Please check environment variables PYSPARK_PYTHON and PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON are correctly set.
```
✅ **Solution**

You can do this by adding the following code snippet at the beginning of your PySpark script or notebook:
```python
import os
import sys

os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = sys.executable
os.environ['PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON'] = sys.executable
```
